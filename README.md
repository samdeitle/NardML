# NardML
A playground and repository of learning materials for machine learning and AI.


###Resources
These are some of the resources we will be looking at to learn and help. Definitely not exhaustive, and I don't take credit for any of them.

This is a book on... well, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It follows the example of a network designed for recognition of handwritten text throughout.

Again, painfully obvious titles of things. This is a list of 17 ML libraries across different languages. I'm leaning towards either Spark in java, or getting started in MatLab from scratch, and moving on to some java libraries for actual implementations.

Read more stuff! Add things here!
